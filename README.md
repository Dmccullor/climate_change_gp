# Rising Sea Levels and Their Impact

## Overview
With this project we will use machine learning to predict when global ice levels will reach zero and what the resulting sea level will be. 

## Results
RIP every coastal city. JK.

## Summary
By the year 2100 we will have lost all of our sea ice and sea levels will have risen to a historic height of 50 feet above our first obervations in 1980.
