# Rising Sea Levels and Their Impact

## Overview
With this project we will use machine learning to predict when global ice levels will reach zero and what the resulting sea level will be. 

## Description
We are taking two data sets and combining them to see the impact of the melting of polar ice caps on the rest of the world. We have one data set that measures average sea level and one that measures the amount of polar ice remaining. Using linear regression we will find when the the year in which polar ice will be completely melted and what the sea level will be that year. We will combine our data with images of projected flooding zones for various cities to show the impact of the rise in sea level.

## Summary
Within the next 60 years we will have lost all sea ice if current trends continue. Coastal cites around the world will see major flooding. Many will be devastated by the amount of water that will cover once inhabited areas.
